## How to Use:
Visit [the website](https://dmtrung14.github.io/mathinspiration), and click on the problem you want to solve.
Inside, there will be ``accordions`` that cover the theory and the solution to the problem

The ``toggle fullscreen`` button will lead you to the full screen Scratch game.

## Deployment:

In order to deploy the website, you will need to have Jekyll installed on your computer. Jekyll is a very excellent static-web template builder. Full documentations on Jekyll can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)

To install Jekyll, we need to download and install a `Ruby+Devkit` version from [RubyInstaller Downloads](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). Use default options for installation.

After that, install Jekyll and Bundler using `cmd` by typing `gem install jekyll bundler`. Type `jekyll -v` to check the version of jekyll installed.

This website is also hosted using github website. On how to create a github website with jekyll, I find [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqFjuX4VZmU) exceptionally helpful, and I personally followed Mike's instruction when I first started blogging.

Briefly explained, you first have to go to your repository `Setting` on github, and change your `Page` settings to `Deploy from a branch`. (GitHub has made site deployment much easier recently), and configure the source in your `config.yml` file.
